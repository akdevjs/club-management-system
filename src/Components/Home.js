          Our club community continues to thrive—and we’re tremendously grateful
          for our members’ support. After <br /> School Programs are up and
          running for the kids. Swimming, racquet sports, arts & crafts, and
          many more <br /> activities are available. And we are utilizing our
          expansive indoor and outdoor spaces for all types of <br /> fitness.
          We can’t wait to see you!
